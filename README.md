Counter Strike, but chickens only.



A plugin in which players move like chickens, look like chickens, sound like chickens, BUT, they also have guns.
The goal is simply to kill the enemy team, but as you have very little health and are too slow to evade fire, you must hide with normal chickens scattered across the map.

When you hold your knife, you cannot do damage and are hidden (nobody will see your gun), but as soon as you draw a gun, it will appear at your side, and will become an easy target. To behave like a real chicken, you can make sounds with a command (bind it to a key).
You would think it's easy, because you would just have to kill every chicken and hope you kill a player, but you cannot kill more than one non-player chicken until you kill yourself.

This plugin also modifies the smokes and the decoys: Smokes creates a lot of chickens so you can hide with them, and the decoys creates a chicken with your weapon drawn, to bait the other team.

If the server operator enables it with a cvar, players can choose their own skin and hat with commands, he can also choose the amount of non player chickens to spawn (and more, see convar section)

This plugin is best played in small maps like demolition or arms race, in classic casual or competitive. If you play on these maps, don't forget to set mp_buy_anywhere 1, because they do not have buy-zones. You can also make your own map!
